# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.9.9.5] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **First-run onboarding** — signup auto-authenticates and navigates to `/getting-started`. Three-step onboarding page (install tool, capture session, create project) with live completion indicators. State-based redirect gate: 0 sessions + 0 projects → onboarding. API key shown in dismissible banner after signup. User-scoped dismissal via djb2 hash (not global to browser). Legacy key migration for upgrade path.
- **Sort direction toggle** — ascending/descending on all sort modes in the dashboard. CLI adds `--sort messages-asc` and `--sort tokens-asc` for finding small sessions.
- **Tool sort mode** — real "Sort: Tool" in the sessions list groups by tool label.
- **Tool filter alias normalization** — `gemini` / `gemini-cli` and `copilot` / `copilot-cli` treated as the same family across list, search, and admin endpoints.

### Changed
- **Cloud Run min-instances** — API deployment now sets `--min-instances 1` to eliminate cold-start latency.
- **OnboardingGate loading** — shows lightweight placeholder instead of blank screen or mounting SessionList prematurely (avoids extra folder/handoff queries for first-time users).
- **Publish Container Images workflow** — now supports `workflow_dispatch` for manual retrigger with configurable ref.

### Fixed
- **Unified 410 delete propagation** — structured `SyncDeletedError` replaces string-based detection. Shared `cleanup_deleted_session()` helper wired into all three sync paths (bulk `sfs sync`, explicit `sfs push`, daemon autosync). Dashboard-deleted sessions are auto-cleaned locally on next sync instead of showing red 410 errors.
- **Full local cleanup on server 410** — removes `.sfs` directory + SQLite index entry (both `sessions` and `tracked_sessions` tables) + adds to exclusion list. No more orphaned local copies.
- **Migration 030 cross-DB backfill** — replaced raw PostgreSQL-only `INTERVAL` syntax + `is_deleted = 1` with SQLAlchemy Core queries (works on both PostgreSQL and SQLite). Handles NULL `deleted_at` with sensible defaults.
- **`sfs delete` / `sfs restore` prefix resolution** — now resolves session ID prefixes via local store for all scopes (was only resolving for local/everywhere, not cloud).
- **`sfs rules init` TTY guard** — fails fast with clear message when stdin is not a TTY and `--yes` is not passed.
- **Sessions empty state** — now links to `/getting-started` and `/help` instead of bare `sfs push` command.

## [0.9.9.4] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Three-scope session delete** — `sfs delete <id>` with `--cloud` (server only, keep local), `--local` (device only, keep cloud), or `--everywhere` (both). No default — explicit choice required. Confirmation prompt with `--force` bypass for automation.
- **Sync-aware deletes** — autosync respects intentional deletes via `~/.sessionfs/deleted.json` exclusion list. Push and pull skip excluded sessions. `sync_push` un-delete path is gated behind `X-SessionFS-Undelete: true` header with ETag conflict check — autosync can never reverse a delete.
- **`sfs trash`** — lists soft-deleted sessions in the 30-day retention window with scope badges and purge dates.
- **`sfs restore <id>`** — reverses a soft-delete on the server, clears local tombstone, prints `sfs pull` guidance when local copy was removed.
- **Dashboard delete dialog** — replaces the single `confirm()` with a two-choice dialog: "Remove from cloud" or "Delete everywhere". One-line explanation per option.
- **Dashboard Trash view** — filter toggle on the session list showing soft-deleted sessions with scope badges, purge dates, restore buttons, and scope-aware restore guidance toast.
- **Admin purge endpoint** — `POST /api/v1/admin/purge-deleted` hard-deletes expired soft-deleted sessions and their blobs. Single-session or bulk. Returns purge count and bytes reclaimed.
- **Restore response guidance** — `POST /sessions/{id}/restore` returns `restored_from_scope` and `local_copy_may_be_missing` so clients can show accurate recovery guidance.
- **Migration 030** — `deleted_by`, `delete_scope`, `purge_after` columns on sessions table.

### Changed
- **DELETE endpoint** — now requires `?scope=cloud|everywhere` query parameter (was parameterless). Returns 200 with session record including `purge_after` (was 204). Old clients without `?scope=` get 400.
- **Storage quota** — soft-deleted sessions excluded from used-bytes calculation.
- **Share links** — return 410 Gone for deleted sessions (was 404).

### Fixed
- **Autosync un-delete bug** — the original soft-delete was immediately reversed by autosync pushing the local copy. Now gated by explicit intent header + ETag check.
- **Purge audit atomicity** — purge and audit log now committed in a single transaction (was two separate commits).

### Security
- **CVE-2026-40347** — python-multipart bumped from `>=0.0.9` to `>=0.0.26` (DoS via crafted multipart preamble/epilogue).
- **Purge endpoint hardening** — session_id format validation + atomic audit logging.

## [0.9.9.3] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **End-to-end resume smoke tests** — 3 tests exercising the actual `resume()` command wiring with real file writes, mocked API boundary, and stubbed tool launch. Proves: missing target file gets created before launch, unmanaged file is skipped without `--force-rules`, preflight failure does not abort resume.
- **Recursive nested skills/agents provenance** — `instruction_provenance` capture now discovers files recursively under `.agents/`, `.claude/commands/`, `.claude/skills/`, etc. (was flat-only). Uses `os.walk` with deterministic sorted traversal, symlink skipping, and a 30-file-per-root bound.

### Fixed
- **Provenance docs misstatements** — docs said the source-provenance line is "omitted" when absent (it actually prints a fallback message), and said "meaningfully initialized" checks `rules_versions` rows (it only checks `enabled_tools` / `static_rules` / `tool_overrides`). Both corrected in `docs/rules.md` and `site/.../rules.mdx`.
- **Provenance capture summary table** — added to docs: 4-row table (managed / unmanaged / global / nested) showing what's captured and whether it's reconstructable.

### Documentation
- **Provenance reconstruction semantics** — docs now explicitly state that unmanaged/global artifacts are hash-only (not reconstructable), and that resume uses current canonical rules by default (not historical session rules). Historical replay deferred to v0.9.10.

## [0.9.9.2] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- **Session push 500 with instruction provenance** — `rules_hash` column was `String(64)` but captured hashes are `sha256:` + 64 hex = 71 chars. PostgreSQL enforced the length and raised on INSERT. Fix: strip the `sha256:` prefix before storing (hex digest alone is sufficient for identity matching) + migration 029 widens the column to `String(80)` for defense-in-depth.
- **`sfs push --yes`** — new flag to skip the interactive DLP confirmation prompt. Findings are still displayed but don't block the push. Required for non-interactive environments (CI, scripts, daemon autosync).

## [0.9.9.1] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- **Migration 028 boolean defaults** — `server_default=sa.text("1")` on `project_rules.include_knowledge` and `include_context` worked on SQLite but PostgreSQL rejects `1` as a boolean literal. Changed to `sa.text("true")` to match the project's Postgres-compatible migration pattern. v0.9.9 prod API deploy failed the Alembic migration step; v0.9.9.1 clears it. No data impact — the broken migration never committed a transaction.

## [0.9.9] - 2026-04-14

### Added

#### Rules Portability — canonical project rules compiled to five tool formats
- **Canonical rules per project** — new `project_rules` + `rules_versions` tables (migration 028) with 4 new columns on `sessions` for instruction provenance. Managed via `GET/PUT /api/v1/projects/{id}/rules`, compiled via `POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/rules/compile`.
- **Five tool compilers** — deterministic partial-compile-aware compilers for Claude Code (`CLAUDE.md`), Codex (`codex.md`), Cursor (`.cursorrules`), Copilot (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`), and Gemini (`GEMINI.md`). Each embeds a SessionFS managed marker at the top of the file.
- **Knowledge + context injection** — compilers pull active claims (default `convention` + `decision` types) and project context sections (default `overview` + `architecture`) with per-tool token ceilings and progressive condensation.
- **`sfs rules` CLI** — `init` (auto-detects existing rule files + recent session-history tool usage, preselects from the 5 supported tools), `edit`, `show` (in-sync state), `compile` (with `--tool X`, `--dry-run`, `--force`), `push`, `pull`. `--local-only` at init adds compiled files to `.gitignore`; the default is shared-in-repo.
- **Managed-file safety** — `sfs rules compile` refuses to overwrite a user-maintained rule file unless `--force` is set. Detection reads only the first 512 bytes so markers buried in hand-written content don't trigger false positives.
- **Session instruction provenance** — session manifests now carry `rules_version`, `rules_hash`, `rules_source` (`sessionfs` / `manual` / `mixed` / `none`), and `instruction_artifacts[]`. Managed files record version + hash only (content lives in `rules_versions`); unmanaged / global artifacts store path + hash + source + scope. `SFS_CAPTURE_GLOBAL_RULES=off` suppresses global hashing for privacy-sensitive environments.
- **MCP tools** — read-only `get_rules` and `get_compiled_rules` for agents. No agent self-modification of rules.
- **Dashboard Rules tab** — new `RulesTab` under ProjectDetail with version badge, static preferences editor, enabled tools checklist, knowledge/context injection settings, per-tool compiled output viewer, version history list, and compile action. ETag-based optimistic concurrency with 409 toast on stale saves.

#### Resume-Time Rules Sync — carry the behavior contract across tools
- **Preflight during `sfs resume`** — before launching the target tool, partial-compile only that tool's rule file from current canonical rules and write it with managed-file safety (Case A write / Case B refresh / Case C warn-skip / Case D `--force-rules` overwrite). Supported resume targets: claude-code, codex, copilot, gemini.
- **Source session provenance display** — shows what rules shaped the original session before launching the resumed session (e.g. `Source session used rules v3 (sessionfs). Current project rules are v5. Synced codex.md from SessionFS rules v5.`). Hash-based provenance survives environments where content snapshots were intentionally suppressed.
- **New flags on `sfs resume`** — `--no-rules-sync` skips the preflight entirely; `--force-rules` overwrites an unmanaged target rule file with SessionFS-managed content. `--force-rules` is a one-time permission — the file becomes SessionFS-managed afterward and subsequent resumes refresh it normally.
- **Meaningfully initialized** — preflight compiles and writes only when the project has curated content (`enabled_tools` non-empty, `static_rules` non-empty, or `tool_overrides` non-empty). Untouched default rules rows skip cleanly.
- **Non-fatal semantics** — rules sync failure never fails the resume itself. Warning to stderr, resume continues, exit 0.
- **Partial-compile guarantee** — any compile request with an explicit `tools` override is treated as partial and never bumps canonical history, regardless of whether the override matches `enabled_tools`.

### Fixed
- **Helm chart invalid semver** (`chart.metadata.version "0.9.8.6" is invalid`) — fixed by the v0.9.9 bump. Four-segment versions aren't valid semver; the chart now tracks the same 3-segment version as the Python package.
- **Compile hash included managed marker** — regression fix: `content_hash` is now the body hash only (marker-independent), so no-op detection doesn't break after a version bump. No more infinite-version-bump loops.
- **Atomic optimistic concurrency on PUT /rules** — `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` row lock ensures two writers holding the same prior ETag can't both commit. Second one receives 409.
- **Concurrent compile race** — version-number contention now retries idempotently; colliding with a same-body-hash winner short-circuits to no-op and aligns local `rules.version` to the winner.
- **First-time rules creation race** — `get_or_create_rules` catches `IntegrityError` and returns the winner's row rather than raising 500.
- **Knowledge injection determinism** — claim ordering priority (decision > convention > pattern > dependency) moved into SQL `ORDER BY` so LIMIT respects it; deterministic `id DESC` tie-breaker on identical timestamps.
- **Path traversal defense** — added `_safe_target_path()` in `cli/cmd_rules.py` used by both `sfs rules compile` and resume preflight; validates target file against canonical `TOOL_FILES[tool]` and confirms the resolved path stays inside `git_root`.
- **Provenance logging visibility** — `watchers/provenance.py` failures now log at `warning` level (was `debug`) so breakage is visible in normal daemon operation. Still non-fatal to session capture.
- **Malformed compile payload hardening** — `preflight_target_tool_rules()` validates `outputs` is a list and `filename`/`content` are strings; returns structured `api-error` result instead of raising.

### Security
- **CVE-2025-71176** — pytest bumped from `>=8.0,<9.0` to `>=9.0.3,<10.0` (dev dependency only; /tmp DoS under certain test configurations).

## [0.9.8.6] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **Knowledge Base v2 — claim model** — three-layer lifecycle: evidence (raw facts from sync) → claim (promoted active truth) → note (rejected or dismissed). New columns on `knowledge_entries`: `claim_class`, `entity_ref`, `entity_type`, `freshness_class`, `supersession_reason`, `promoted_at`, `promoted_by`, `retrieved_count`, `used_in_answer_count`, `compiled_count` (migration 027).
- **Per-type freshness decay** — new `src/sessionfs/server/services/freshness.py` applies per-type windows: bug 30d, dependency 60d, pattern/discovery 90d, convention 180d, decision 365d. Entries decay from `current` → `stale` → `archived` based on `last_relevant_at`.
- **Auto-promotion at compile** — evidence with `confidence >= 0.5` and `content >= 30 chars` is automatically promoted to `claim` at the start of each compile pass, so compile pulls from a stable active-claim pool.
- **Supersession** — `PUT /api/v1/projects/{id}/entries/{entry_id}/supersede` retires an old claim and links it to a superseding entry with a reason. Superseded entries remain readable for audit but are excluded from compile.
- **Refresh endpoint** — `PUT /api/v1/projects/{id}/entries/{entry_id}/refresh` updates `last_relevant_at` and resets `freshness_class` to `current`; replaces the old "Still valid" no-op (which called undismiss on non-dismissed entries).
- **Rebuild endpoint** — `POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/rebuild` resets `compiled_at=NULL` on all active claims and clears `context_document`, forcing a full compile on settled projects where `compile` would otherwise be a no-op.
- **`sfs project rebuild` CLI** — new command mirrors the rebuild endpoint.
- **Writeback gates for agent contributions** — `add_knowledge` (MCP + API) defaults to `claim_class="note"`. Auto-promotes to `claim` only if specificity gate, semantic dedup (Jaccard-min ≥ 0.85), and rate limit pass. Returns classification feedback so agents know when their entry was rejected vs accepted vs promoted.
- **Section pages as true projections** — compile iterates ALL known types from `slug_map`, not just types in the pending batch. Section pages with zero active claims are deleted inline (previously went stale indefinitely).
- **`used_in_answer_count` tracking** — MCP `ask_project` and API search expose a `_used_in_answer` flag that increments this counter on retrieval, feeding the freshness signal.
- **Dashboard `KnowledgeEntriesTab` v2** — health banner with stale review queue, claim/freshness badges, filter controls, provenance blocks (entity ref + promoted_by + retrieved/used counts), promote/supersede/refresh/dismiss actions, rebuild button.

### Changed
- **Compile default budget lowered to 2000 words** (from 8000) — active-truth-per-token principle produces sharper context documents. Migration 027 backfills existing projects with `kb_max_context_words = 8000 OR NULL` to the new default.
- **Search filters to active claims by default** — `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/entries/search` excludes evidence, notes, and superseded entries unless `include_stale=true`.
- **MCP `search_project_knowledge`** — same default; returns active-claim results with provenance.
- **MCP `get_project_context`** — filters to active claims when constructing the compiled document.

### Fixed
- **Concept page prune filter** — compile filtered dead pages by `page_type == "auto"`, but concept pages are stored as `page_type == "concept"`. Dead pages were never pruned.
- **`dismiss-stale` safety guard** — added `confidence < 0.5` constraint to prevent bulk-dismissing medium-confidence entries that haven't been referenced recently.
- **Daemon startup order** — `_fetch_remote_settings()` now runs before `full_scan()`. Previously a slow settings fetch blocked watcher startup by ~95 seconds on fresh installs.
- **Codex watcher NoneType crash** — `payload.get("content") or []` pattern in 4 places (content, summary, action blocks); prior code crashed when Codex emitted null fields, halting the entire watcher loop.
- **Daemon PID resolution fallback** — `sfs daemon stop` now falls back to `daemon.json` when `sfsd.pid` is missing, fixing orphaned daemon processes after crashes.

### Documentation
- **`sfs dlp scan/policy` in site CLI docs** — added to `site/src/content/docs/cli.mdx`.

## [0.9.8.5] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- **Dashboard Help page** (`/help`) — MCP-first guidance with 8-tool installer (`sfs mcp install --for <tool>`), agent prompt examples, curated CLI reference, 12-tool MCP reference, external resource links.
- **Admin org back-office endpoints** — `GET/POST /api/v1/admin/orgs` + `PUT /api/v1/admin/orgs/{id}/tier` for internal provisioning, bypassing the Team+ subscription gate.
- **Bulk dismiss-stale endpoint** — `POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/entries/dismiss-stale` atomically dismisses old low-confidence entries (< 0.5 confidence + > 90 days unreferenced). Dashboard surfaces a "Dismiss N stale" button in the knowledge health banner.
- **Dashboard health banner** — `ProjectDetail` Entries tab surfaces stale/low-confidence/decayed counts + actionable recommendations from the health API.
- **Self-hosted Security Posture documentation** — new section in `docs/self-hosted.md` and `site/src/content/docs/self-hosted.mdx` covering non-root UIDs, read-only rootfs, capability drops, seccomp, and `trivy config` verification.
- **`sfs dlp` CLI documentation** — `docs/cli-reference.md` now documents `sfs dlp scan` and `sfs dlp policy` subcommands.

### Fixed
- **Dashboard signup broken on app.sessionfs.dev** — `VITE_API_URL` unset at Vercel build time; `baseUrl` defaulted to `window.location.origin` (static host), returning 405 on POST. Fixed three ways: env var set in Vercel, URL baked into bundle, `app.*` → `api.*` fallback in code.
- **Unguarded localStorage across dashboard** — `main.tsx`, `ThemeToggle`, `SettingsPage` assumed a full Storage interface. Now all call sites use `src/utils/storage.ts` helper with full guards.

### Security
- **GitLab webhook user binding** (HIGH) — webhook accepted any per-user secret match but discarded which user it belonged to, then loaded credentials from `sessions[0].user_id`. A forged MR payload could impersonate another user's GitLab token. Fixed: bind `auth_user_id` to the matching row, scope session lookup + credential load to that user.
- **GitHub installation claim IDOR** (HIGH) — `PUT /settings/github` blindly claimed the first unclaimed installation. Fixed: require `installation_id` from the client, time-windowed claim (15 min), 403/410 on violations, atomic conditional `UPDATE ... WHERE user_id IS NULL` to prevent race conditions.
- **Effective-tier leak** (MEDIUM) — `sync_push` upload limit and `/api/v1/sync/status` read `user.tier` directly instead of resolving the effective org tier. Enterprise org members with personal `free` tier got 50 MB limits. Fixed: both paths now use `get_effective_tier(user, db)`.
- **`pr_comments` unique index scoped** (MEDIUM) — migration 026 widens the unique index from `(repo_full_name, pr_number)` to `(installation_id, repo_full_name, pr_number)` to match runtime query scoping.
- **Security Scan workflow rebuilt** — replaced `aquasecurity/trivy-action` with raw `trivy` binary (`setup-trivy@v0.2.6`, `trivy v0.69.3`); renders Helm chart before misconfig scan; `--severity CRITICAL,HIGH` exit-code enforcement.
- **Dockerfile hardening** — `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile.mcp` now create a non-root `sessionfs` user (UID 10001) and set `USER 10001` before CMD.
- **Helm chart hardening** — PostgreSQL StatefulSet + `helm test` hook pod now have full `securityContext` with `readOnlyRootFilesystem`, `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`, `capabilities.drop: [ALL]`, `seccompProfile: RuntimeDefault`. Fixed pre-existing bug where fallback emptyDir volume was at StatefulSet spec level instead of pod spec level.
- **4 CVE patches** — vite 7.0.0→7.3.2 (3 CVEs), defu ≤6.1.4→6.1.5 (prototype pollution) in `site/package-lock.json`.

### Knowledge Base Lifecycle
- **LLM compile budget enforcement** — `_trim_to_budget()` now applied after LLM response, not just on the simple-compile path.
- **Semantic dedup on all extraction paths** — shared `word_overlap()` + `is_near_duplicate()` helpers; both deterministic and LLM extraction now run a 3-layer filter (exact-match, project-wide overlap, intra-batch).
- **Concept page pruning** — new `_prune_dead_concept_pages()` runs unconditionally before candidate check; fixed `page_type` filter (`"auto"` → `"concept"`).
- **Health stale-entry count** — includes entries with old `last_relevant_at`, not just `IS NULL`.
- **Bulk dismiss confidence guard** — only dismisses entries with `confidence < 0.5`.

### Daemon / Sync
- **Codex watcher crash** — `payload.get("content", [])` returns `None` when key exists with explicit null. Fixed in 4 places with `payload.get("content") or []` pattern.
- **Daemon startup delay** — `_fetch_remote_settings()` moved before watcher `full_scan()` so autosync mode is correct immediately (308 ms vs 96 s).
- **`sfs daemon stop` fallback** — new `_resolve_daemon_pid()` prefers `sfsd.pid`, falls back to `daemon.json`. Both stop and status use it. Also clears `daemon.json` on stale-PID cleanup.
- **DB pool config** — `SFS_DATABASE_POOL_SIZE`, `MAX_OVERFLOW`, `POOL_TIMEOUT`, `POOL_RECYCLE` env vars wired through `ServerConfig` → `init_engine()`.

### Tests
- Backend: 1052 → **1091** (+39 tests in 4 new files: billing webhooks, sync promotion failures, GitHub claim, knowledge lifecycle)
- Dashboard: 22 → **76** (+54 tests in 7 new files: BillingPage, GitHubIntegrationSection, HandoffDetail, ProjectDetail, SessionDetail, AdminDashboard, OrgPage)
- Codex null-content regression tests (2 new)

## [0.9.8.4] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **Dashboard Help page** — new `/help` route with MCP-first guidance, an 8-tool installer (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Cursor, Copilot, Amp, Cline, Roo Code) with live terminal preview and copy-to-clipboard, example agent prompts by use-case, a curated 10-command CLI quick-reference, the full 12-tool MCP reference, and external resource links. Help icon sits between ThemeToggle and the avatar; a Help entry also appears in the mobile drawer.
- **Helm chart Security Posture documentation** — new "Security Posture" section in `docs/self-hosted` covering non-root UIDs, read-only root filesystems, dropped capabilities, RuntimeDefault seccomp, and how to verify with `trivy config` on a rendered chart.

### Fixed
- **Dashboard signup broken on app.sessionfs.dev** — `VITE_API_URL` was not set at Vercel build time, so the LoginPage `baseUrl` defaulted to `window.location.origin`, making signups POST to the static Vercel host and return 405. Fixed three ways: (1) set `VITE_API_URL=https://api.sessionfs.dev` in Vercel for all three environments, (2) bake the URL into the new production bundle, (3) derive `api.<domain>` from `app.<domain>` in the fallback chain so this cannot silently break again.
- **Unguarded localStorage across dashboard** — `main.tsx`, `ThemeToggle`, and `SettingsPage` assumed a full Storage interface. Now all call sites route through a new `src/utils/storage.ts` helper that guards against missing localStorage, plain-object localStorage (vitest 4 + jsdom), SecurityError on access, and QuotaExceededError on write. Shared vitest setup installs an in-memory stub so every test file gets a working localStorage.
- **Help page theme query stale** — resource links now subscribe to `document.documentElement[data-theme]` via `MutationObserver` so sessionfs.dev links update live when the user toggles theme on the Help page.

### Security (post-release hardening)
- **Helm chart — postgres StatefulSet** — container now has a full `securityContext` with `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`, `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`, `runAsNonRoot: true`, `capabilities.drop: [ALL]`, and `seccompProfile.type: RuntimeDefault`. Added `emptyDir` mounts at `/tmp` and `/var/run/postgresql` so postgres can still write its socket directory with a read-only root filesystem. Also fixed a pre-existing bug where the fallback `emptyDir` volume (when `persistence.enabled=false`) was declared at the StatefulSet spec level instead of the pod spec level, making it ineffective.
- **Helm chart — `helm test` hook** — the curl-based connection test pod now has pod and container `securityContext` with `runAsUser: 10001`, `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`, dropped capabilities, and RuntimeDefault seccomp.
- **Dockerfile + Dockerfile.mcp** — both now create a non-root `sessionfs` user (UID 10001) and set `USER 10001` before `CMD`. Cloud Run and Kubernetes already enforced non-root at the orchestration layer, but the image itself is now compliant for self-hosted users who don't override.
- **Security Scan workflow rewrite** — replaced `aquasecurity/trivy-action` with raw `trivy` binary (via `setup-trivy@v0.2.6`, `trivy v0.69.3`) because the action's `severity:` input does not filter exit-code for `scan-type: config`. Now renders the Helm chart with `helm template` before running misconfig scan so Trivy evaluates real Kubernetes manifests instead of raw `{{- with .Values }}` templates (which produced 40+ false-positive findings on an already-hardened chart). Also enforces `--severity CRITICAL,HIGH` and excludes `node_modules` / `.venv` from the secret scan.
- **vite 7.0.0–7.3.1 → 7.3.2** — fixes three CVEs in `site/package-lock.json`: CVE-2026-39364 (server.fs.deny bypass), CVE-2026-39363 (WebSocket arbitrary file read), CVE-2026-39365 (path traversal in optimized deps). Build-time only; site is statically generated.
- **defu <=6.1.4 → 6.1.5** — fixes CVE-2026-35209 (prototype pollution via `__proto__` key in defaults argument). Transitive dep in the site build.

## [0.9.8.3] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- **Connection pool exhaustion** — client-side `asyncio.Semaphore(5)` limits concurrent uploads; server-side per-user semaphore (max 3) with 429+Retry-After; sync client retries 429 with backoff.
- **sync_push connection lifecycle** — split into 3 phases: DB reads → release connection → blob upload (no DB) → fresh session for writes. Connection held ~70ms instead of ~5s.
- **Sync race condition** — blob uploaded to temp key, row committed with temp key first (PK constraint for creates, FOR UPDATE for updates), blob promoted only after commit. Temp blob preserved on any post-commit failure.
- **Pool health endpoint** — `GET /health/pool` returns pool utilization metrics.
- **Sync summary** — shows error count alongside pushed/pulled/conflicts.

## [0.9.8.2] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- **Database pool exhaustion** — API pods were using SQLAlchemy defaults (pool_size=5, max_overflow=10) causing 500 errors under load. Now configurable via `SFS_DATABASE_POOL_SIZE` (default 20), `SFS_DATABASE_MAX_OVERFLOW` (default 40), `SFS_DATABASE_POOL_TIMEOUT` (default 60s), `SFS_DATABASE_POOL_RECYCLE` (default 1800s). Connections verified with `pool_pre_ping=True`.

## [0.9.8.1] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Knowledge base lifecycle** — entry decay (0.8x confidence after 90 days unreferenced), auto-dismiss past retention period, configurable per-project settings (`kb_retention_days`, `kb_max_context_words`, `kb_section_page_limit`).
- **Quality gates on knowledge entries** — minimum 20 char content, 20/hr rate limit per session, 85% similarity rejection, lower confidence cap for manual/CLI entries.
- **Context document budget** — 8,000 word default cap with priority-aware trimming (high-confidence entries kept first).
- **Section page caps** — 30 items default, "N older entries not shown" footer.
- **Concept page auto-refresh** — regenerate when cluster grows 50%+, auto-delete when all entries dismissed.
- **Actionable health endpoint** — returns recommendations, stale/low-confidence/decayed entry counts.
- **`sfs resume --model`** — specify model for target tool (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini supported; Copilot warns).
- **Concept auto-generation fix** — stop word filtering, meaningful phrase extraction, trigrams for better topic names.
- Database migration 025: lifecycle fields on knowledge_entries + project settings.

### Fixed
- Billing webhook: `_sync_billing_to_org` requires positive match on both customer_id AND subscription_id. Personal subscription events cannot mutate org state.
- Billing webhook: `_find_user_or_org_by_customer` uses subscription_id to disambiguate legacy same-customer data.
- Billing webhook: non-active downgrade clears `stripe_subscription_id`.
- DLP pre-scan only runs when org policy is enabled (not unconditionally).
- `pack_session()` snapshots files into memory before tarring (fixes active session push).
- Session list sorts by `updated_at` (not `created_at`).
- Concept auto-generation filters stop words — no more "From The" or "Instead Of" concepts.
- Dashboard billing page uses typed `BillingStatus` interface.
- `SessionDetail` type includes `dlp_scan_results`.

## [0.9.8] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **DLP / Secret Scrubbing** — pre-sync content protection with 14 PHI patterns (SSN, MRN, DOB, NPI, patient name, etc.) and 22 secret patterns. Three enforcement modes: BLOCK, REDACT, WARN. Server-side scan of all archive files, org policy via settings JSON, custom patterns and allowlist support.
- **DLP CLI** — `sfs dlp scan <session_id>` for local scanning, `sfs dlp policy` to view org policy. `sfs push` shows DLP preview when org policy is enabled.
- **DLP Dashboard** — Settings > DLP tab for org admins (enable, mode, categories). Session detail shows DLP findings section with pattern types and action taken.
- **DLP API** — `GET/PUT /dlp/policy`, `POST /dlp/scan` (dry-run), `GET /dlp/stats`. Feature-gated to Pro+ tier.
- Database migration 024: `dlp_scan_results` column on sessions.
- 43 new DLP tests (PHI patterns, false negatives, category filtering, allowlist, custom patterns, redaction, policy validation).

### Changed
- Session list sorts by `updated_at` instead of `created_at` — most recently active sessions appear first.
- `pack_session()` snapshots file contents into memory before tarring — handles active sessions with concurrent daemon writes.

### Fixed
- **Billing webhook isolation** — `_find_user_or_org_by_customer()` uses `subscription_id` to disambiguate legacy same-customer data. `_sync_billing_to_org()` requires positive match on both `customer_id` AND `subscription_id` — personal subscription webhooks can never mutate org state.
- **Billing non-active downgrade** — `past_due`/`unpaid`/`paused`/`incomplete_expired` now clears `stripe_subscription_id` on both org and user rows.
- **DLP pre-scan** — only runs when org DLP policy is enabled, not unconditionally on every push.
- **Dashboard type safety** — `SessionDetail` type includes `dlp_scan_results`, `BillingPage` uses typed `BillingStatus` interface.

### Security
- DLP scanning runs server-side at the sync chokepoint — even modified clients cannot bypass it.
- Redacted content (`[REDACTED:TYPE]`) replaces matches in ALL `.json`/`.jsonl` archive files. Original text never stored.
- Org DLP policy changes are admin-only and merge (don't overwrite custom_patterns/allowlist).

## [0.9.7.4] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- **MCP workspace detection** — all 6 project-scoped tools now use MCP `roots/list` protocol to detect workspace directory from the AI tool client, with CWD fallback.
- **MCP explicit git_remote** — `search_project_knowledge`, `ask_project`, `add_knowledge`, `update_wiki_page`, and `list_wiki_pages` now accept an optional `git_remote` parameter, matching `get_project_context`. Fixes "No git repository detected" when roots protocol is unavailable.
- **0-byte index.db recovery** — truncated index files are now detected and deleted on startup, triggering automatic rebuild from .sfs files.
- **Auto-reindex on empty index** — if index has 0 sessions after schema creation, flags for full reindex.

## [0.9.7.3] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Knowledge base docs** — new page covering the full knowledge loop, entries, compile, wiki, MCP write tools, API endpoints, best practices.

- **MCP docs** — all 12 tools documented in 3 categories with full parameter tables.
- **API reference** — added 16 missing endpoints across auth, sessions, share links, handoffs, settings.
- **Quickstart** — added `sfs init` wizard, project knowledge setup, `sfs doctor`.
- **Project context docs** — compile workflow, auto-narrative, knowledge loop integration.
- **Environment vars** — added Stripe, URL, and storage/retention variables.
- **Docs landing** — "memory layer" tagline, knowledge base and dashboard cards, 70+ commands.
- **Site sidebar** — Knowledge Base in Features, new Platform section (Dashboard, Organizations, Billing).
- **Pro tier features** — added "Living knowledge base", "Agent write-back (MCP)", "Project context + wiki".

### Fixed
- `sfs project ask` URL-encodes search queries (spaces in questions broke API calls).
- `sfs project ask` uses keyword-based search instead of exact phrase matching.
- Site knowledge base page: corrected tool names (`update_wiki_page`, `list_wiki_pages`).
- Site footer tagline: "Portable AI coding sessions" → "Memory layer for AI coding agents".
- Docs: removed nonexistent `POST /auth/login` endpoint from self-hosted guide.
- Docs: DLP and enterprise features marked as planned/coming (not shipped).
- Docs: resume `--in` targets corrected to 4 bidirectional tools only.

- **Sessions hero** — compact action-oriented layout with prominent Resume button, inline handoff/project chips.
- **Session rows** — stronger titles, dimmer metadata, solid Resume button on hover.
- **Project cards** — health badges (sessions, auto-narrative), name as title, skeleton loading.
- **Project detail tabs** — fade transitions, sliding underline, workflow hints, context tab as hero artifact.
- **Typography** — stronger light-mode contrast, 6-level type scale, tuned brand color.
- **Product identity** — site-aligned typography and tokens, updated shell and login branding.
- Deduplicated `formatBytes`, `getAvatarColor`, `TOOL_COLORS` into shared utils.

### Fixed
- MCP remote server "No read stream writer available" race condition — `asyncio.Event` ensures transport connected before handling requests.

## [0.9.7.1] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **GitLab settings CRUD** — `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/settings/gitlab` for bootstrapping GitLab MR integration.
- **Watchlist status API** — `PUT /sync/watch/{session_id}/{status}` for daemon sync lifecycle tracking.
- **Handoff metadata snapshots** — session title/tool/model/tokens frozen at handoff creation (migration 021).
- **Knowledge backfill** — creating a project backfills knowledge from already-synced sessions via blob archives.
- 5 new compiler integration tests (repeated compile dedup, unverified promotion, mixed confidence, cross-batch).

### Fixed
- **Billing isolation** — org Team checkout creates separate Stripe customer; webhook handlers use org-first branching; personal-vs-org subscription detection throughout portal/status/checkout.
- **Handoff security** — recipient verification on claim, auth required on detail/summary, claimed summary blocked, recipient session ID persisted and returned from all routes.
- **Knowledge compiler** — content-level dedup (not session-level bail), verified/unverified promotion across compiles, ephemeral section rebuild, low-confidence entries only in Unverified, intra-batch dedup.
- **Sync engine** — conflict re-dirtying, selective watchlist fetched from server, pagination for remote session list, cross-user session-ID reuse blocked, stale file cleanup on pull.
- **Admin dashboard** — user_id→id contract fix, activity tab endpoint/fields, self-demotion guard, search param, enterprise/starter tiers, org membership cleanup on delete.
- **MCP install** — stale registration repair, malformed config handling, timeout isolation, UnicodeDecodeError handling.
- **Share links** — passwords moved from GET query to POST body, PBKDF2 hashing with salt, configurable API URL, alias-aware revoke.
- **Webhooks** — GitHub signature enforcement when secret configured, GitLab route path fix (`/webhooks/gitlab` → `/gitlab`), GitLab MR comment dedup tracking, per-user webhook secret verification.
- **Dashboard** — compile refreshes all project/wiki queries, search shows aliases, quick preview uses newest-first, jump-to-message always forces oldest-first, message order resets on session change, mobile nav for Billing/Admin, accessible dialogs, keyboard support, billing error display.
- **Org management** — seat capacity re-checked on invite acceptance, invite email normalization, signup email normalization.
- Database migrations 020–023.

### Security

- Share-link password storage upgraded from SHA-256 to PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with random salt.
- GitHub webhooks reject missing signature when secret is configured.
- Handoff detail/summary endpoints require authentication; restrict access to sender/recipient.
- Claimed handoff summaries return 410 (no data leakage after claim).
- Cross-user session-ID reuse blocked on sync push.
- Same-user session-ID reuse expires pending handoffs and revokes share links.
- Org non-admin members cannot access org Stripe portal.

- Added "Test Connection" button to AuditModal for custom base URLs

## [0.9.4] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Session lineage** — `parent_session_id` tracked through resume, sync push, and API. `sfs show` displays parent/children. `sfs list --tree` groups by lineage. Dashboard shows fork banner and "↩ fork" badges.
- **Cursor tool call extraction** — reads `agentKv:blob:` layer from Cursor's SQLite DB. Sessions go from 0 to 900+ tool calls, making audit functional for Cursor.

### Fixed
- **Claim extractor for Claude Code** — two-strategy extraction (tool-context + standalone regex). 0 claims → 54+.
- **Auto-audit wiring** — `on_sync` trigger now calls audit API after push. `on_pr` checks user setting in webhook handler.
- **GitLab webhook DB session** — uses `_session_factory` instead of non-existent `app.state.db_session_factory`.
- **Daemon settings poll** — async `httpx.AsyncClient` instead of blocking sync `httpx.get`.
- **SummaryTab crash** — moved `useState` hooks before conditional returns (React hooks rules).
- **Audit modal ignores base URL** — `runAudit` now passes `base_url` through full chain.
- **Model discovery with saved key** — server falls back to user's encrypted key when no explicit key provided.
- **Handoff resume path** — falls back to CWD when sender's path doesn't exist on receiver's machine.
- **SQLite "database locked"** — `busy_timeout=5000ms` on session index and MCP search index.
- **`sfs config show`** — Rich markup no longer swallows TOML `[section]` headers.
- **`sfs summary --today`** — checks both local and UTC dates, checks `updated_at` too.
- Evidence truncation raised from 200 to 2000 chars.
- Proper error responses: 422 for 0 claims with tool calls, 502 for LLM errors, 504 for timeouts.

- Daemon debounces session changes before pushing (30s default, configurable)
- Daemon polls API for settings changes every 60 seconds
- `sync_watchlist` database table for selective mode tracking

### Fixed
- **Handoff claim now copies session data** — blob is duplicated in storage, new session record created for recipient (was only recording `claimed_at` without copying)
- **Ingress routes all traffic through dashboard nginx** — removed separate `/api` and `/mcp` ALB target groups that stayed in "unused" state on EKS
- **Nginx body size limit** — added `client_max_body_size 100m` (configurable via `dashboard.clientMaxBodySize`) to prevent 413 on large session uploads
- MCP proxy added to dashboard nginx for internal routing

## [0.8.3] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- `SFS_SMTP_VERIFY_SSL` — disable SSL certificate verification for internal SMTP relays with self-signed certs

### Fixed
- Handoff email showed wrong command (`sfs pull --handoff`) — corrected to `sfs pull-handoff`
- CLI handoff hint showed same wrong command
- LLM Judge returned 403 when using custom base URL without API key (Ollama, local vLLM) — API key is now optional when `base_url` is set
- SMTP email logger not visible in uvicorn container logs — propagated to root logger

## [0.8.2] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Custom base URL for LLM Judge** — `--base-url` flag, `SFS_JUDGE_BASE_URL` env var, and dashboard settings field for LiteLLM, vLLM, Ollama, Azure OpenAI, and any OpenAI-compatible gateway

- Project context database migration (projects table)
- Judge base URL database migration (user_judge_settings.base_url column)
- `docs/project-context.md` guide

### Fixed
- **Codex resume broken** — rollout files used `source: "custom"` which Codex CLI rejects on resume; changed to `source: "cli"` with `originator: "codex_cli_rs"`
- Codex rollout missing `output`/`exit_code` on `local_shell_call` payloads and `status` on `function_call` payloads
- Codex rollout had extra fields (`id`, `end_turn`) on message payloads that native format doesn't use
- `sfs resume --in codex` hint said `codex --resume` (wrong flag) then `codex --thread` (wrong flag) — Codex uses `codex resume` subcommand

### Changed
- `sfs resume` now auto-launches the target tool instead of printing a copy-paste command:
  - Claude Code: `claude --resume <id>`
  - Codex: `codex resume <uuid>`
  - Gemini: `gemini --resume latest`

## [0.8.1] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed

- Rate limiter now respects `SFS_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` environment variable — was hardcoded to 100, now reads config (default 120, set to 0 to disable)
- Removed `?sslmode=require` from Helm database URL template — asyncpg handles SSL internally
- MCP service port corrected from 3001 to 8080 in Helm chart — fixes pod crash-loops from failed health probes
- Dashboard no longer hardcodes `api.sessionfs.dev` — uses `VITE_API_URL` env var, falls back to `window.location.origin`
- Dashboard health endpoint returns JSON `{"status":"ok"}` instead of plain text
- S3 bucket names containing `/` (e.g. `my-bucket/prefix`) are split gracefully into bucket + prefix
