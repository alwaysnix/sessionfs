## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **Audit report export** — download as JSON, Markdown, or CSV (CLI `--format` + dashboard dropdown)
- **OpenRouter provider** — access 400+ models via single API key, auto-detected by `/` in model name
- **Stored judge API keys** — Fernet-encrypted at rest, Settings page in dashboard
- **Audit status indicators** — trust score badges on session list, detail sidebar, handoff emails, CLI list
- **`GET /api/v1/auth/me`** — returns user profile (email, tier, verified status)
- **Latest model dropdowns** — Opus 4.6, GPT-5.4, Gemini 3.1, DeepSeek V3.2/R1, o3, o4-mini

### Fixed

- Audit using hardcoded blob path instead of session.blob_key
- UTF-8 decode error when reading session archives with non-ASCII content
- AuditReport type not imported in dashboard AuditTab
- CLI `sfs auth status` now shows email, tier, and verification status

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **Team handoff with email notifications** — `sfs handoff --to email --message` sends notification via Resend with session metadata, git context, and pull instructions
- **Smart workspace resolution** — when pulling a handoff, automatically finds the recipient's local clone by matching git remote URLs
- **Handoff dashboard** — inbox/sent tabs, detail page with claim button, handoff modal on session detail
- **LLM-as-a-Judge hallucination detection** — `sfs audit` evaluates AI responses against tool call evidence (BYOK — user provides their own API key)
- **Multi-provider judge** — supports Anthropic, OpenAI, Google via httpx (no SDK dependencies)
- **Consensus mode** — `sfs audit --consensus` runs 3 passes, reports only where 2+ agree
- **Trust score badges** — session list shows green/yellow/red audit badges
- **Audit dashboard tab** — expandable findings with verdict icons, severity badges, evidence
- **Compatibility guide** — `docs/compatibility.md` with full 8-tool matrix and technical reasons for capture-only
- **Remote MCP server** — `mcp.sessionfs.dev` with OAuth 2.1 PKCE + Dynamic Client Registration

### Changed
- Pricing: free tier changed from 25-session count to 14-day rolling retention
- Capture-only CLI messages now include tool-specific reasons and Copilot in alternatives
- Quickstart rewritten as 5-step hero workflow
- README restructured: hero workflow first, advanced features below
- Judge uses temperature=0 for deterministic output
- Judge verdict rules tightened: hallucination requires proof of contradiction, absence of evidence is unverified

### Fixed
- Dashboard auth persistence via sessionStorage (survives refresh)
- Vercel SPA routing (catch-all rewrite for direct URL access)
- Integer overflow on token counts (bigint migration 004)
- Duplicate search bar removed from session list
- All lint errors fixed (ruff clean, mypy clean)
- Node.js 24 opt-in for GitHub Actions
